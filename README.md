# Directions

1. Upload multiple distinct files in the following format:

2. Then press the corresponding "Choose Effect" button for each list to pick a random item.

"Choose Effect" was used because the randomizer tool was made originally to help choose random effects for Dungeons and Dragons. I may or may not make the button label more generic.
The application keeps a log of each effect chosen in reverse order so your last item appears on top.

# TODO
CSV support for multiple lists at a time.
Probably code and data flow improvements.
